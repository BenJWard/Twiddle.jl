# Twiddle.jl

Twiddle.jl is a package collecting useful bit-twiddling tricks, ready to use as
functions, with detailed documentation of what they do, and example real-world
use cases.

This package originated from a PostDoc project where we wanted to do some common
biological sequence operations much much faster than a naive implementation
could, by taking advantage of succinct bit-encoding of the sequences.

This package however is supposed to be more general, and we want it to contain
many bit-twiddling tips and tricks.
